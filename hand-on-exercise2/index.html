    <h1>Surfing</h1>
    <p>Surfing is a surface water sport in which the wave rider,
        referred to as a surfer, rides on the forward or face of
        a moving wave, which usually carries the surfer towards the shore.</p>
    <h1>Terms</h1>
    <p>The Glossary of surfing includes some of the extensive vocabulary
        used to describe various aspects of the sport of surfing as described
        in literature on the subject.[19][20] In some cases terms have spread
        to a wider cultural use. These terms were originally coined by people
        who were directly involved in the sport of surfing.</p>
    <h1>Equipment</h1>
    <p>Surfing can be done on various equipment, including surfboards, longboards,
        stand up paddle boards (SUPs), bodyboards, wave skis, skimboards, kneeboards,
        surf mats and macca's trays. Surfboards were originally made of solid wood and
        were large and heavy (often up to 370 cm (12 ft) long and having a mass of 70 kg
        (150 lb)). Lighter balsa wood surfboards (first made in the late 1940s and early 1950s)
        were a significant improvement, not only in portability, but also in increasing maneuverability.</p>
